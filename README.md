#  Mastodon GO!  #

__*Mastodon GO!*__ is an alternative frontend for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) which supports the additional features provided by the [`glitch-soc`](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/) fork.
It began as a refactor/redesign of statuses and then spread to become a rewrite of the entire frontend, because that's kinda how Mastodon development works ðŸ˜“.

For more information on _Mastodon GO!_, you might want to check out [this blog post](http://marrus.xyz/ledger/mastodon/introducing-mastodon-go-020171031.html), where I explain in more detail my approach in developing it and various aspects of its design.
