#  CONTRIBUTING  #

Before you get all rearing to submit your PR, you should take a moment to consider your approach.

If your approach is ‚ÄúGolly gee, _Mastodon GO!_ does this thing *wrong* and I'm going to make it *right*!‚Äù, that's cool and I'm glad you're enthusiastic but you'd probably be better off just forking the software than trying to argue a PR üòú.
_Mastodon GO!_ does things the way it does for a reason, and if you don't like those things or those reasons then participating in development will probably not be a very fun time for you lol.

In terms of priorities, code that is down-to-earth and accessible is valued above code that is extra-professional or mightily efficient.
If your thought-process is ‚ÄúI'm going to change X to match Y programming trend or marginally boost Z efficiency,‚Äù you should first think about what the consequences of that change will be regarding keeping the codebase straightforward and friendly.
If you can't implement your change in a simple and inviting manner, you might want to head back to the drawing board and rethink it over.

That said, if you're thinking ‚ÄúHey, _Mastodon GO!_ does a ton of stuff right and I really appreciate it, and *for that reason* I want to help make it better!‚Äù, first of all, thanks, and secondly, welcome to the club üòâ.
The process for contributing is roughly as follows:

1.  Develop an implementation of your new feature, bugfix, or solution to the problem.

2.  Test and edit your implementation to be as clear and straightforward as possible.

3.  Submit a PR with your code, and explain what it does.

4.  Someone else will test your code, potentially rewriting aspects for clarity or to match [styling conventions](CONVENTIONS.md).

5.  Documentation for the code will be written/updated.

6.  If everything looks good, the code will get merged.

Not everyone has the same amount of time to spend on this stuff, but as a general rule of thumb, the more time you spend on the first 3 items, the less time it will take for the last 3.
If what you're developing is a bugfix or small change, jumping into the code is probably fine.
If it's a larger change or new feature, you should probably open an issue and maybe get approval first, just to be sure that you're not putting a lot of work in for nothing üòÖ.
