#  INSTALLING  #

_Mastodon GO!_ currently only runs on a Mastodon server running [`glitch-soc`](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon).
Support for vanilla Mastodon or "unhosted" installs may be added at some point in the future.

To install, simply add the `mastodon-go` folder into `app/javascript/themes`â€”you may want to use git submodules to make staying updated easier.
To do this, run the following code from your Mastodon root directory:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/marrus-sh/mastodon-go app/javascript/themes/mastodon-go
```

You can then update the frontend by running:

```
git submodule update app/javascript/themes/mastodon-go
```
