#  INSTALLING  #

The recommended means of using the _Tootledge_ package is via a [Subtree Merge](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Subtree-Merging) into a GlitchSoc flavour.
For example, this is how [_Mastodon GO!_](https://github.com/marrus-sh/mastodon-go/) does things.

_Tootledge_ expects that it is being used inside of a GlitchSoc installation; that is, that the usual GlitchSoc packages are available through the expected methods.
