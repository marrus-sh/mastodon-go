|   =======                                                           |
|                                                                     |
|   `connect()` is a replacement function for the one with the same   |
|   name in React-Redux.  It takes in a selector factory (making it   |
|   actually more similar to `connectAdvanced()`) and calls it with   |
|   a function named `go()`.                                          |
|                                                                     |
|   `go()` is essentially a wrapper for `dispatch` which makes code   |
|   like the following:                                               |
|                                                                     |
|       go(fn, ...args);                                              |
|                                                                     |
|   be evaluated as though it were instead code like the following:   |
|                                                                     |
|       dispatch(fn(...args, go, current, api));                      |
|                                                                     |
|   (Note that `current` is just another name for `getState`.)        |
|                                                                     |
|   This means that action creators which would normally be written   |
|   as follows:                                                       |
|                                                                     |
|       const myAction = (arg1, arg2) => (dispatch, getState) => {    |
|         const api = apiGeneratorFunction(getState);                 |
|         //  Function code                                           |
|       }                                                             |
|                                                                     |
|   can instead be written more simply as:                            |
|                                                                     |
|       const myGoAction = (arg1, arg2, go, current, api) => {        |
|         //  Function code                                           |
|       }                                                             |
|                                                                     |
|   Note also the ease at which one can dispatch the `go()`-enabled   |
|   action creator, compared to the traditional one:                  |
|                                                                     |
|       dispatch(myAction(var1, var2));  //  Messy                    |
|       go(myGoAction, var1, var2);      //  Clean                    |
|                                                                     |
|   Using our `connect()` function allows us to write cleaner, more   |
|   straightforward action creators, and minimize the level of code   |
|   duplication we have with regard to API calls in particular.  It   |
|   is a tiny bit magic and a tiny bit hack so be careful where you   |
|   swing it around.                                                  |
|                                                                     |
|   One especially important thing to note is that `go()` will only   |
|   (and always) provide `go`, `current`, and `api` to the function   |
|   it is called with if the provided `...args` fail to exhaust the   |
|   function's `length`.  This helps to keep us from creating `api`   |
|   objects that we won't use, but it does mean that every argument   |
|   to a function must be specified explicitly.  If a function were   |
|   to be specified with too few arguments, then `go` etc. would be   |
|   provided to the wrong argument slot, and if too many, then they   |
|   may not be provided at all.                                       |
|                                                                     |
